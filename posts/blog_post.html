                        A website is one of the most crucial tools businesses or individuals can use to nurture their digital presence. Whether you&apos;re a small firm, a large corporation, or a freelancer, making a website is a highly effective way to make yourself more visible on the world wide web.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        If you have an account on social media, you are part of an audience of more than 3.5 billion people &ndash; almost half of the total population of the planet &ndash; who have a presence on the internet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        However, although they are accessible platforms, free and global, social networks can limit your digital strategy. That is in terms of the control of information, formats that you can publish, or lead generation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Thus, if what you want is to spread your products or services online, your work as a freelancer or the knowledge you have acquired in your professional domain, the best alternative is to have a space that is completely customizable and adaptable to your needs, and that space is a website.

                        A website is a place on the internet where you can keep information for others to see. This can be information about yourself, your business, or even topics of your interest. Based on the website category, people can also use them to shop, chat, study, and get entertained.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        All websites are identified by a unique address, which tells browsers where they are located.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Simply put, when you enter a web address into your browser, it goes to that specified location and retrieves the web page. The process of retrieving this information is carried out by a web service using technologies such as <a href="">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a> and <a href="" >File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</a>, which essentially define how information and files are transmitted over the web.
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The browser then displays the retrieved web page on your screen using technologies such as <a href=""> Markup Language (HTML)</a> and <a href="">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</a>. They structure and present the web page&apos;s information to the visitor by telling the browser exactly where to put what on the screen.
                    </p>

                <div >
                    <p class="paragraph">When we type a certain URL in a browser search bar, the browser requests the page from the Web server and the Web server returns the required web page and its content to the browser</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">Most websites can be classified into two broad types, static and dynamic. Your website purpose will help you determine what type your website should be.</p>
                </div>

                <h3 class="h3-title">static website</h3>
                
                <div >
                    <p class="paragraph">A <a href="https://fakesite.com/tutorials/static-website" class="out-side-hyperlink">static website</a> is fairly straightforward in terms of design and functionality, often serving a simple purpose.In <a href="https://fakesite.com/tutorials/static-website" class="out-side-hyperlink">Static Websites</a>, Web pages are returned by the server which are prebuilt source code files built using simple languages such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.There is no processing of content on the server (according to the user) in Static Websites. Web pages are returned by the server with no change therefore, static Websites are fast. There is no interaction with databases. Also, they are less costly as the host does not need to support server-side processing with different languages.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Static web pages can&apos;t take input from visitors but may still contain animations and clickable elements such as hyperlinks or navigation buttons.<a href="#" class="out-side-hyperlink">Skyline Furniture MFG</a> is an ideal example of a static website. It uses static pages made from basic HTML to display text, images, and navigation links that take you to other pages.</p>
